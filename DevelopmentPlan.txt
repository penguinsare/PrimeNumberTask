Project Development Plan

day 1:
 - set up a Web Api project with .Nert Core 3.1
 - add github project und push to github
 - add a library project for the algorithm
 - add a test project with xUnit and create test cases
 - test numbers 1 to 100, 0, -1 to -100
day 2:
 - define a prime number:
	A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number 
	greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.
	Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number
 - implement the find-if-a-number-is-prime algorithm 
 - implement the find-next-prime-number algorithm 
 - add an endpoint to each algorithm:
	1) the number should be passed through the URL with /{id}
	2) implement the API calls as GET methods	
	3) create a common error response format
 - add Swagger UI 
day 3: 
 - test the API with Insomnia
 - integration test for the endpoints if the time is enough
 - write the dockerfile
